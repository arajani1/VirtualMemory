# VirtualMemory
This project implements a virtual memory (VM) system using segmentation and paging. The system manages the necessary segment and page tables (PTs) in a simulated main memory. It accepts virtual addresses (VAs) and translates them into physical addresses (PAs) according to the current contents of the segment and PTs.
