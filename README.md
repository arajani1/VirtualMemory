# VirtualMemory
This project implements a virtual memory (VM) system using segmentation and paging. The system manages the necessary segment and page tables (PTs) in a simulated main memory. It accepts virtual addresses (VAs) and translates them into physical addresses (PAs) according to the current contents of the segment and PTs.

To run my program the VMManager.py file has to be run in the same package as the PhysicalMemory.py file. 
The input and output files are specified in the first few lines of the VMManager file and need to be provided.

It should be run with demand paging.
